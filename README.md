# ObsidianCollect-Vectorize

While [obsidian 🟣](https://obsidian.md/) gives a lot of possibilites and functionality, one may wish to manipulate their notes on another level - semantic. 
This project is an easy-to-use 3-in-1 tool for analysis and manipulation. Three stages include:
- Scrapping of notes
- Building ml-redy dataset on top of scrapped data
- Vectorization via QWEN2-VL and building directed graph with embeddings for further usage
