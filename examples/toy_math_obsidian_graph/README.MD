Hi!
This is a toy obsidian graph dataset consisting of ~50 samples which is a very early snapshot of my actual real life obsidian vault.
The specifics of data are as following:
 - RU/EN language 🇷🇺+🇬🇧 
 - heavy mathjax usage 💲💲
 - embedded images of different ratios 🖼️
 - graph is incomplete and includes orphan nodes 🕸️
